# Spotify Listening Dashboard Excel Project

## üìä Project Overview

This Excel-based dashboard provides a detailed and interactive exploration of my Spotify listening history, covering over **145,000** individual play events spanning multiple years. By meticulously cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the raw data, the dashboard uncovers meaningful patterns in listening behavior, skip habits, platform preferences, and temporal trends.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps

1. **Duplicate Removal**  
   - Identified and removed exact duplicate rows to ensure each playback event is unique.
2. **Integrity Checks**  
   - Filtered out records missing essential fields such as timestamp or track name.
3. **Timestamp Standardization**  
   - Converted all timestamps to a uniform datetime format in the system‚Äôs locale (Asia/Kolkata) to support consistent time-based analysis.
4. **Derived Metrics**  
   - **Playtime (minutes)**: Computed from duration for better readability.
   - **Skip Flag**: Marked events where a track was stopped before 30 seconds as a skip.
5. **Categorization**  
   - Mapped playback contexts into broader categories (e.g., Albums, Tracks, Artists etc.).
